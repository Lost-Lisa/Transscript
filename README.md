# Transscript
 This transcript audio editor Idea enables a user to edit his/her audio to text then there by editing the transcript text and any changes in text also changes in the audio. 

 

ABSTRACT--- 
 
THIS PAPER DESCRIBES THE PROCESS BY WHICH HIGH-DEFINITION AUDIO CAN BE CAPTURED. IN ADDITION, WE DESCRIBE HOW TO EDIT THE RECORDED AUDIO TO COMBINE FAST AND EFFICIENT WAYS TO EDIT THE AUDIO FEED WITH SIMPLE TRANSCRIPT MODIFICATION THAT WILL ALSO MAKE CHANGES TO ORIGINAL AUDIO. 
KEYWORDS: TRANSCRIPT, AUDIO, EDITOR, SPEECH 
 

 
 
 
INTRODUCTION 
 
MOST LARGE-SCALE MEDIA INDUSTRY IN THE WORLD TODAY, ESPECIALLY IN THE DEVELOPED WORLD OCCUR AT THE CLICK OF A BUTTON. HOWEVER, IT WOULD BE AN EXTREMELY NARROW POINT-OF-VIEW TO SEARCH FOR IMPROVEMENTS FROM ONLY THE CURRENTLY EXISTING FIELD OF CONTENT CREATION. THE UNTAPPED MARKET CONSISTING OF OFFLINE EDITING STILL DOMINATES THE MAJORITY OF WORK IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES AND IT WOULD BE EXTREMELY MYOPIC TO IGNORE IT. 
THERE IS ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT IN THIS MARKET AND A FORM OF HYBRIDIZATION BETWEEN ONLINE AND OFFLINE WORK SHOULD BE LOOKED AT AS THE NEXT STEP IN DEVELOPING. IT ALLOWS FOR THE RAPID AUDIO EDITING AND SCRIPTS OF AUDIO MARKETS WHILE STILL KEEPING TO THE SIMPLICITY, MAKING IT EASIER TO IMPLEMENT IT, ESPECIALLY TO A SINGLE PERSON WITH LOTS AUDIO VIDEO EDITING. IN THIS ARTICLE, WE WILL AT FIRST COVER THE PRIMARY TECHNOLOGIES THAT WILL FORM THE BACKBONE FOR THE APPLICATION: CLOUD SPEECH TO TEXT. AFTER THAT, WE WILL PROVIDE A BASIC WALKTHROUGH OF THE STEPS INVOLVED IN THE THEORETICAL APPLICATION ALONG WITH ITS USAGE AMONG THE USER POPULATION FOR CONTENT CREATOR, EDITOR ETC. ALIKE. FINALLY, WE WOULD END ON THE PROSPECTS OF THIS PROJECT AND CONCLUDE ON WHAT IS NECESSARY FOR SUCH A PROJECT TO WORK. 
AT ITS CORE, THE ARTICLE WOULD SERVE AS A PROPOSAL FOR THIS THEORETICAL APPLICATION AND IT IS EXPECTED THAT FUTURE PROJECTS WOULD SEE THE SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS APPLICATION, AT LEAST AT THE PRACTICAL LEVEL. 
 
 
 
 
CONCEPTS 
 
HERE LET US INDIVIDUALLY DISCUSS INDIVIDUAL TECHNOLOGY BEFORE MOVING TO THE APPLICATION ITSELF. 
 
CLOUD SPEECH-TO-TEXT API RECOGNITION 
A SPEECH-TO-TEXT API SYNCHRONOUS RECOGNITION REQUEST IS THE SIMPLEST METHOD FOR PERFORMING RECOGNITION ON SPEECH 
AUDIO DATA. SPEECH-TO-TEXT CAN PROCESS UP TO 1 MINUTE OF 
SPEECH AUDIO DATA SENT IN A SYNCHRONOUS REQUEST. AFTER SPEECH-TO-TEXT PROCESSES AND RECOGNIZES ALL OF THE AUDIO, IT RETURNS A RESPONSE. 
A SYNCHRONOUS REQUEST IS BLOCKING, MEANING THAT SPEECH-TO-
TEXT MUST RETURN A RESPONSE BEFORE PROCESSING THE NEXT 
REQUEST. SPEECH-TO-TEXT TYPICALLY PROCESSES AUDIO FASTER 
THAN REALTIME, PROCESSING 30 SECONDS OF AUDIO IN 15 SECONDS ON AVERAGE. IN CASES OF POOR AUDIO QUALITY, YOUR 
RECOGNITION REQUEST CAN TAKE SIGNIFICANTLY LONGER. 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
APPLICATION 
 
THE APPLICATION ITSELF, REGARDLESS OF MATTERS LIKE THE UI 
WOULD CONSIST OF A USER INPUT WHERE THERE ARE TWO OPTION TO RECORD AUDIO OR TO EDIT RECORDED AUDIO THAT IS SAVED ALREADY. THIS APPLICATION WORKS IN BY TAKING AUDIO AS INPUT THEN PROCESSING THAT INPUT AUDIO TO CLOUD SPEECH TO TEXT API, RESULTS ARE TIMESTAMP OF EVERY WORD SPOKEN AND A FULL TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO. 
NOW ONCE AGAIN THIS APPLICATION ASK FOR INPUT FROM THE USER TO ENTER MODIFIED TRANSCRIPT, THEN THE APPLICATION WILL COMPARE MODIFIED TRANSCRIPT WITH ORIGINAL TRANSCRIPT, FOLLOWING THIS METHOD IT WILL ALSO MAKE CHANGES TO AUDIO BY REMOVING AUDIO THAT ARE NOT PRESENT IN MODIFIED TRANSCRIPT THUS A NEW AUDIO IS GENERATED TO THE USER AS TRIMMED AUDIO AS MODIFIED TRANSCRIPT. 
 
 
 
 
 
PROCEDURE 
 
TO UNDERSTAND HOW EXACTLY THE SOFTWARE IS SUPPOSED TO WORK, IT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO EXPLAIN BY LOOKING AT IT FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF THE TWO KINDS OF USERS IT WOULD HAVE; NAMELY THE CLOUD AND USER. 
 
FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF THE CLOUD 
 
EMPOWER YOUR CUSTOMER SERVICE SYSTEM BY ADDING IVR (INTERACTIVE VOICE RESPONSE) AND AGENT CONVERSATIONS TO YOUR CALL CENTERS. PERFORM ANALYTICS ON YOUR CONVERSATION DATA TO GAIN MORE INSIGHTS INTO THE CALLS AND YOUR CUSTOMERS. SPEECH-TO-TEXT AND ITS ENHANCED PHONE CALL MODELS ARE ALREADY POWERING GOOGLE CLOUD’S POWERFUL SOLUTION, CONTACT CENTER AI. 
  
 
 
FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF THE USER 
 
THIS TRANSCRIPT AUDIO EDITOR IDEA ENABLES A USER TO EDIT HIS/HER AUDIO TO TEXT THEN THERE BY EDITING THE TRANSCRIPT TEXT AND ANY CHANGES IN TEXT ALSO CHANGES IN THE AUDIO. FOR EXAMPLE: AUDIO HAS: "MY NAME IS AVINASH SINGH STUDYING IN UNIVERSITY AMITY KOLKATA" AUDIO TO TEXT: " MY NAME IS AVINASH SINGH STUDYING IN UNIVERSITY AMITY KOLKATA " 
EDITING TEXT: " MY NAME IS AVINASH SINGH STUDYING IN AMITY KOLKATA " FINAL AUDIO: " MY NAME IS AVINASH SINGH STUDYING IN UNIVERSITY AMITY KOLKATA " SO, HERE USER SEES, ORIGINAL 
AUDIO HAS SOME UNWANTED “UNIVERSITY“ ETC TO EDIT THIS IN EDITOR TAKES LESS TIME FOR SHORT AUDIO. HOWEVER, IF YOU ARE DOING THIS FOR 1HR VIDEO AND TRYING TO FIND UNWANTED AUDIO THEN THIS WOULD BE VERY TIME CONSUMING. THIS TRANSCRIPT AUDIO EDITOR IDEA HELPS TO SOLVE SUCH PROBLEM WITH FEW OR SINGLE CLICKS FOR WHOLE AUDIO.  
  
 
FUTURE PROSPECTS 
 
WITH THE SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION OF SUCH AN APPLICATION AT THE BASE LEVEL, THERE IS OPPORTUNITY FOR GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT INCLUDING THE INCLUSION OF NEW FEATURES IN THE FUTURE. AT PRESENT THE TWO PRIMARY FEATURES PLANNED TO BE ADDED AT A LATER STAGE ARE: 
 
 
 
CONCLUSION 
 
AT PRESENT, THIS APPLICATION IN ORDER TO PRODUCE RESULTS IN 
PRACTICAL STAGE. HOWEVER, UI IS NOT IMPLEMENTED, IT JUST 
LOOKS LIKE NAY PYTHON SCRIPT THAT WORKS. THERE IS ROOM FOR 
MANY IMPROVEMENTS LIKE COMBINING THIS WITH VIDEO EDITOR 
CAN BE DONE ALSO INSTEAD OF REMOVING FROM ORIGINAL 
TRANSCRIPT, ADDING OF AUDIO IN USER VOICE CAN ALSO BE PERFORMED USING ML TO MAKE APPLICATION LEARN USER VOCALS AND THIS EXPRESSION OF SPEECH. 
GIVEN TIME AND RESOURCES, SAY IN A MAJOR PROJECT, AT THE VERY LEAST THE PROTOTYPE FOR SUCH AN APPLICATION CAN BE A REALITY. THAT WOULD NOT BE THE END HOWEVER, AS IT WAS STATED IN THE 
PROSPECTS, THERE WOULD BE ROOM TO GROW AND IMPROVE AND THE FINAL PRODUCT CAN BE SOMETHING THAT STUDENTS OF AMITY UNIVERSITY WOULD BE PROUD TO HAVE DEVELOPED.
